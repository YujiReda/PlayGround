# Code of Conduct

## Objectives & Scope
As a group of developers coming from different countries and cultures, we should strive to achieve a concise way of cooperation for this project.
This Code of Conduct specifies a set of rules and expected behaviour from the project's contributors to maintain a pleasant and efficient environment.
The Code of Conduct applies throughout the Software Development Process during the production of the Feedback Platform for the CSE1105 OOP Project at TU Delft.

## Our Standards
Within our project's team, we should strive to follow the following standards:

### Project Environment Standards
* Use inclusive and open language, with being respectful to others experience and differences 
* Strive to voice ideas and opinions during the meeting, especially during brainstorming on new aspects of the platform or way of implementing features 
* Be open to constructive criticism, given by other contributors to improve the quality of work
* Help each other within the code development process to achieve possibly best practices and code quality
* Assign major tasks to a group of developers rather than to one person, to work alongside project contributors instantly familiar with the issue
* When needed, reach out for help to other project's contributors via Discord, Mattermost, mail etc.
* Fulfil all the hard deadlines imposed by the course organizers, as well as abide by soft deadlines specified within the group
* Attend weekly meetings with TA and CTA and BuddyChecks' peer reviews

### Project Collaboration Standards
* Receive at least one approve from another team member, before merging project branches to the development branch
* Receive at least two approves from other team members, before merging project branches to the master branch
* Create merge requests only if the pipeline of the final branch's commit passes
* Strive to include some comments and/or code reviews once reviewing another team member Merge Request
* Construct the commit messages in the following way (Beams, 2014):
  * Capitalize and use an imperative mood in the commit topic sentence
  * Try to limit commit message to 50 characters
  * Do not end commit messages with a period
  * State the subject of the commit and its purpose, rather than specifying implementation
  * Divide commit into topic sentence and body, if it is not possible to encapsulate the commit message in 50 characters (If so divide these parts with a blank line)
* Create project's branches in the following format `feature/issueId-branch-name`
* Make use of the GitLab Collaboration Tools ex. issues, code reviews, boards

### Documentation Standards
* Each week assign the roles of a chair/scrum master & note taker
* Each week deliver two types of project documentation files:
  * Agenda with Sprint Review - This should include the assignment of the documentation roles, the points of discussion with the TA/CTA, tasks of all group members for the incoming week
  * Sprint Retrospective - This should include a check of the completed tasks from the past week, a brief retrospective on the encountered issues and an applied way of resolving them
* Deliver versions of the aforementioned documents weekly, and before Tuesday's TA meetings
* Additional documents produced during the project, which specify the development process and/or features to the build platform, should be added under the `docs` folder

### Resolving Issues
If excessive breaches of this Code of Conduct arise, or there would be a need to specify additional behaviour aspects in this CoC, we should discuss the matter at the next group meeting.
All the changes to the Code of Conduct should be done with total group acceptance.
If we cannot resolve issues during the private meeting, we should consider a discussion of the issue at the next TA meeting.
