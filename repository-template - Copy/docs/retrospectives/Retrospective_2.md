## Tasks & Main Problems Discussion
- **Andrzej:**\
During this week I was responsible for creating a Code of Conduct and providing versions of Agenda and Sprint Retrospective.
My main issue was the lack of knowledge in formatting Markdown documents. 
  After research, I have found the little compendium with compact pieces of information about Markdown: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/.
  
- **Jakub:**\
During week 2 I sketched the GUI for the lecturer side, also I played a bit with the colors we could use in our final application.
Working with adobe xd was fine, the program is self explanatory so I had no problems here. 
I'm still discovering git, during this week I've had some problems with it, but I managed to solve all of them by myself. 

- **Matyáš:**\
I went over the report from the first CTA meeting and used it to create a draft backlock of user stories. Took me a 
while to figure out the granularity of each story, but I managed to split all required features into (mostly) 
independent chunks. Currently they are only prioritized using the MoSCoW scheme, once we transfer the stories to GitLab,
we'll have to rate the stories with story points.

- **Weicheng:**\
In Week 2, I sketched the GUI view for students. 
I never worked with Git before, so I had some problems with using Git initially, such as merging, and easily getting lost when switching between several branches.
  Now after some days of practicing and working with Git, i am more familiar with it.

- **Yuji:**\
I sketched the GUI for the moderator.
I really liked adobe xd and the fact that you can easily change elements using photoshop.
However, I was hesitant on the design decisions as I was unsure how a particular design would affect its implementation.
Also, I am still unsure how git works in different situations but the other colleagues nicely point out my mistakes which helps a lot.

## Potential improvements and State of the Project
Project is well on track with isolating all the requirements for the software. 
During next meeting with Client TA we should check if our idea match client's expectations.
